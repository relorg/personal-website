<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
The majority of this site contains
work that I did in the Astronomy Unit at Queen Mary, University of London, where I did research
on space plasma physics, including work on electron acceleration at collisionless shocks
and the construction of a Beowulf class machine for intensive numerical work.
