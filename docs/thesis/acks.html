The first and biggest "thank you" must go to David Burgess.  He's put up with four years of questions, proof reading and trying to get me to actually finish this thing.

<div class="p"></div>
Thanks to Mum and Dad for doing all the things parents do.  This thesis would never have been finished without your support (both moral and financial!).  I'd also like to thank Chris for distracting me occasionally, but resisting the temptation to ask "how's the thesis?"

<div class="p"></div>
There have been many people along the way who have shaped my interests.  The adverts say "everyone remembers a good teacher" and I would like to remember John Goodger for introducing me to the wonderful world of Physics.  Then at University there was CUAS and Ian Craig, who re-awakened a childhood love of all things Astronomical.  I also want to thank Douglas Gough for his infectious enthusiasm and for suggesting that I might consider doing a PhD here.

<div class="p"></div>
I'm grateful to all the people at Queen Mary, from Steve Schwartz for actually teaching me what a plasma is(!), to Ros and Matt for proving that it can be done.  I've also had a good deal of support at conferences, and I'd like to thank Bertrand Lembege and Markus Aschwanden for showing that there are people in the world who are interested.

<div class="p"></div>
Also thank you to all those who made the process a little more bearable.  Thanks to Chris, Laura and Rupert for actually choosing to live with me!  And a big hello to everyone from Flat 40 (you know who you are!).

<div class="p"></div>
Finally, thank you to PPARC for their less personal, but not insignificant, contribution.
